shell:
  lucky init bonusapp --api --no-auth

psql:
  create database crystal_mserv;
  create user crystal_mserv password 'xxxxxx';
  grant all on database crystal_mserv to crystal_mserv;

*IMPORTANT*
  LuckyCli (v0.12.0) creates project files pointing to LuckyRecord, which does not
  exist now, because it was renamed to Avram.
  So, it's required to replace `lucky_record` & `LuckyRecord` to `Avram` everywhere in this code, and add `avram` to `shard.yml`.
